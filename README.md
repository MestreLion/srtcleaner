SRT Cleaner
===========

A simple tool to clean up SRT subtitle files removing ads and misplaced credits,
also fixing their encoding.


Usage
-----

#### Library

```python
import srtcleaner

srtfiles = ['/data/TVSeries/Cosmos/Cosmos.S01E01.srt',
            '/data/TVSeries/Cosmos/Cosmos.S01E02.srt']

srtcleaner.srtcleaner([srtfiles], in_place=True, backup=False, convert='UTF-8')
```

#### Command-line

```
$ srtcleaner --help

usage: srtcleaner [-h] [-q | -v] [--recursive] [--input-encoding ENCODING]
                  [--input-fallback-encoding FALLBACK_ENCODING]
                  [--convert OUTPUT_ENCODING] [--in-place] [--no-backup]
                  [--no-rebuild-index] [--blacklist BLACKLISTPATH]
                  srtpaths [srtpaths ...]

Clean subtitles deleting items that matches entries in blacklist file. Useful
to remove ads and misplaced credits

positional arguments:
  srtpaths              SRT file(s) or dir(s) to modify

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -q, --quiet           Suppress informative messages and summary statistics.
  -v, --verbose         Print additional information for each processed file.
  --recursive, -r       recurse inside directories.
  --input-encoding ENCODING, -e ENCODING
                        Encoding used in subtitles, if known. By default tries
                        to autodetect encoding.
  --input-fallback-encoding FALLBACK_ENCODING, -f FALLBACK_ENCODING
                        Fallback encoding to read subtitles if encoding
                        autodetection fails. [Default: windows-1252]
  --convert OUTPUT_ENCODING, -c OUTPUT_ENCODING
                        Convert subtitle encoding. By default output uses the
                        same encoding as the input.
  --in-place, -i        Overwrite original file instead of outputting to
                        standard output
  --no-backup, -B       When using --in-place, do not create a backup file.
  --no-rebuild-index, -I
                        Do not rebuild subtitles indexes after removing items.
                        Resulting SRT will not be strictly valid, although it
                        will work in most players. Useful when debugging for
                        comparing original and modified subtitles
  --blacklist BLACKLISTPATH, -b BLACKLISTPATH
                        Blacklist file path. [Default:
                        /home/user/.config/srtcleaner/srtcleaner.conf]

Configuring
-----------

SRT Cleaner will remove any entries that matches any record on its blacklist file,
located by default at `~/.config/srtcleaner/srtcleaner.conf`. Create or edit it
before using `srtcleaner`.

A record can span over multiple lines, so use a blank line to separate each record.
Its text is matched against each SRT entry by a simple `text in entry` comparison,
in a _case-insensitive_ way. So if the whole text is found as part of an entry,
the whole entry is removed from the SRT file. Escape sequences such as '\n' and
'\t' are also interpreted, so you can use '\n' when you want to include a newline
at the end of the text to match.

Example of a basic `srtcleaner.conf`:

Requirements
------------
- [Pysrt](https://github.com/byroot/pysrt), to parse the SRT files
- [file-magic](https://github.com/file/file), to detect encoding.

**Note**: There are (at least) 3 python modules named `magic` available on
PyPI, all wrappers to [`libmagic`](https://github.com/file/file),
but with very distinct API:

  - [file-magic](https://github.com/file/file), from `libmagic` project itself
  - [python-magic](https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic)
  - [filemagic](https://github.com/aliles/filemagic)

SRT Cleaner supports any of the above `libmagic` wrappers, and on install pulls
the one from the `file`/`libmagic` project. And all of them obviously requires
`libmagic` to be installed on your system. It usually ships in the `file`
package and comes pre-installed in most GNU/Linux distributions and MacOS.

On Windows, the following could be used to install `libmagic`:
- [file-windows](https://github.com/nscaife/file-windows)
- [libmagicwin64](https://github.com/pidydx/libmagicwin64)
